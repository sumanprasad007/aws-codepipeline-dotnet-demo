# Deploying ASP.NET Core Web API to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline

In this article, we are going to be deploying ASP.NET Core Web API to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline. In the process, we will learn the basics of AWS Codepipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This article is going to be a bit different from the other ‘Deploy .NET to AWS’ we had gone through earlier, as this will also get you started with CI/CD Pipelines on AWS!

By the end of the article, you will be having an AWS CodePipeline that can deploy your application to AWS ElasticBeanStalk whenever there is a new code push in your GitHub Repository.
